**CODE REFACTORING IN PROGRESS - MUFFIN ISN'T STABLE YET**

If you ask an experienced developer what he's thinking about content management systems, he'll probably tell you that he doesn't like them since they're bloated, overkill and slow as fuck. Muffin would like to change that.

Of course it doesn't yet have those cool features which all the other cool kids on the block are showing off, but it's very ambitious and always has an open ear for feedback from all angles!

## Requirements

To be able to use muffin, you'll need **the latest version** of those things. So please make sure they're updated before trying out this application. After installing node.js, please also make sure to [fix your npm permissions](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/fixing-npm-permissions).

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org)
